# CNet â€“ C++ Networking Framework

**CNet** is a lightweight, cross-platform networking framework written in modern C++, inspired by C#'s `System.Net` and Python's `socket` module.

It provides a clean and intuitive API for creating TCP clients and servers, allowing you to build networked applications quickly and with minimal boilerplate.
